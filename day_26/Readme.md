> Given an array Arr[N] of N integers and a positive integer K. The task is to divide the array into two sub-arrays from right after the Kth position and slide the left sub-array of K elements to the end

Sample input:

```
5 -- Value of N
{10, 20, 30, 40, 50} -- Elements
of Arr []
2 -- Value of K
```

o/p

```
30 40 50 10 20
```

That is the array rotates n number of times
