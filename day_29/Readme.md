> Given two non-negative integers n1 and n2, where n1 < n2. The task is to find the total number of integers in the range interval [n1, n2] [both inclusive] which have no repeated digits.

For e.g.
Suppose n1 = 11 and n2 = 15.
There is the number 11, which has repeated digits, but 12, 13, 14, and 15 have no repeated digits. So, the output is 4

Sample i/p:

```
11 -- Value of n1
15 -- Value of n2
```

Sample o/p:

```
4
```
